# Comparator Design for Light Intensity Measurement

## Requirements

- **Input:** Voltage signal from the photodiode (BPW34) after current-to-voltage conversion.

- **Output:** Three LEDs indicating light intensity levels:
  - Below 300 lux (Red LED)
  - Between 300-500 lux (Yellow LED)
  - Above 500 lux (Green LED)

## Components Needed

- MCP6002 Dual Op-Amp (1 unit)
- BPW34 Photodiode (1 unit)
- Resistors:
  - 10kΩ (2 units)
  - 47kΩ (2 units)
  - 100kΩ (1 unit)
- Potentiometer:
  - 10kΩ trimmer (2 units for threshold adjustment)
- LEDs:
  - Red, Yellow, Green (1 unit each)
- Power Supply:
  - 5V DC (from breadboard power supply)

## Circuit Design

1. **Photodiode Current-to-Voltage Conversion:**
   - Use one op-amp from MCP6002 to convert the photodiode current to a voltage signal. Configure the op-amp in a transimpedance amplifier setup.
   - Resistor value for feedback (Rf): 100kΩ (adjustable based on photodiode sensitivity).

2. **Comparator Thresholds:**
   - Use the second op-amp from MCP6002 as a comparator.
   - Set two threshold voltages using voltage dividers with trimmer potentiometers:
     - Threshold 1: Corresponds to 300 lux.
     - Threshold 2: Corresponds to 500 lux.
   - Connect the photodiode voltage output to the inverting input of the comparator.
   - Connect the threshold voltages to the non-inverting input of the comparator.

3. **LED Control:**
   - Use the comparator outputs to drive the LEDs.
   - Add current-limiting resistors (220Ω) in series with each LED.

## Calculations

- **Threshold Voltages:**
  - Calculate the voltage levels corresponding to 300 lux and 500 lux based on the photodiode's characteristics and the transimpedance amplifier's gain.
  - Adjust the trimmer potentiometers to fine-tune the thresholds.

## Notes

- Ensure proper decoupling capacitors (e.g., 100nF) are placed near the op-amp power pins.
- Verify the photodiode's response curve to ensure accurate lux-to-voltage conversion.
- Test the circuit with a calibrated light meter to validate the accuracy within ±10%.

This design provides a simple and effective way to implement the comparator functionality for the light intensity measurement circuit.
